Use these guides to get to your first evaluated formula quickly.

## Runtime quickstarts

- [Rust Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/rust-quickstart)
- [Python Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/python-quickstart)
- [JavaScript/WASM Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/js-wasm-quickstart)

## Prefer one complete walkthrough?

Go straight to [First Workbook in 5 Minutes](/docs/quickstarts/first-workbook-in-5-minutes).

## Need to debug formula syntax first?

Use the live [Formula Parser](/formula-parser) to inspect tokens, AST output, references, and parser errors before wiring formulas into a workbook.

## Requirements

- Rust quickstart: stable Rust toolchain
- Python quickstart: Python 3.10+
- JS/WASM quickstart: Node 18+

If you are brand new to Formualizer, start at [Introduction](/docs/introduction).
