title: First Workbook in 5 Minutes
description: Build a tiny workbook flow end to end.
---

This walkthrough shows a minimal workbook-style setup: define cells, evaluate formulas, and read resulting values.

## What You Will Do

1. Create an in-memory workbook model.
2. Populate a few values and formula cells.
3. Trigger evaluation.
4. Read and verify computed outputs.

## Suggested Pairing

Pick one runtime quickstart first, then return here for a workbook-oriented workflow:

- [Rust Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/rust-quickstart)
- [Python Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/python-quickstart)
- [JavaScript/WASM Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/js-wasm-quickstart)

> **TODO:** Add a full worked example with expected intermediate and final cell values.
