Use this section to build a shared vocabulary before jumping into API-specific guides.

## In this section

- [Parse -> AST -> Evaluate -> Workbook](./parse-ast-evaluate-workbook)
- [Dependency Graph and Recalculation](./dependency-graph-and-recalc)
- [Values, Coercion, and Errors](./values-coercion-and-errors)
- [Spill Behavior](./spill-behavior)
- [Named Ranges and Tables](./named-ranges-and-tables)

## How to read these pages

- Start with the execution pipeline to understand where each subsystem fits.
- Then learn recalculation + coercion to reason about correctness and performance.
- Finish with spill and naming constructs, which shape real workbook behavior.

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add diagrams for parser and evaluator data flow.
- Add cross-links to function reference examples once generated docs land.
