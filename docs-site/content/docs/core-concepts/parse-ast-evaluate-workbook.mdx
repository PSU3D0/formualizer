title: Parse -> AST -> Evaluate -> Workbook
description: Understand the execution pipeline from formula text to computed workbook values.
---

Formualizer computes results as a staged pipeline:

1. Parse formula text into tokens.
2. Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. Evaluate AST nodes against context.
4. Persist values and dependencies in workbook state.

## Why this model matters

- Each stage has clear responsibilities and test boundaries.
- Errors can be surfaced early (parse) or late (evaluation) with better diagnostics.
- The workbook remains the source of truth for cached values and recomputation.

## Minimal example

```text
Input formula: =SUM(A1:A3)
Parse: tokens [=, SUM, (, A1:A3, )]
AST: Call(SUM, [Range(A1:A3)])
Evaluate: Number(42)
Workbook: cell B1 stores value 42 and dependency edge B1 -> A1:A3
```

## Common debugging checkpoints

- If parse fails, inspect tokenizer and parser diagnostics first.
- If parse succeeds but value is wrong, inspect AST shape before evaluator logic.
- If one cell updates but dependents do not, inspect workbook dependency bookkeeping.

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add real AST node examples from parser snapshots.
- Add section on immutable context propagation during evaluation.
