title: Named Ranges and Tables
description: Use semantic references to improve readability and maintainability of formulas.
---

Named references let formulas describe intent instead of coordinates.

## Why they matter

- `Revenue_Q1` is easier to audit than `Sheet1!B2:B100`.
- Table-style references stay meaningful as data grows.
- Names can centralize workbook assumptions.

## Common usage patterns

- Use workbook-level names for constants and key ranges.
- Use table columns for row-wise calculations.
- Keep naming conventions consistent across teams and bindings.

## Short example

```text
Name: TaxRate = 0.0825
A2 formula: =A1 * TaxRate
```

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Document scope rules (workbook vs sheet) and precedence.
- Add examples for structured table references.
