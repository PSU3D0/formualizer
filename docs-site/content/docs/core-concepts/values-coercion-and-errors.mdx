title: Values, Coercion, and Errors
description: Understand runtime value types, implicit conversions, and spreadsheet-style error propagation.
---

Formualizer operations work over a compact set of runtime values (number, text, boolean, blank, arrays, and errors).

## Coercion rules in practice

- Numeric functions coerce text when valid (for example, "42" -> 42).
- Invalid coercions return spreadsheet errors instead of panicking.
- Blank handling differs by operation (arithmetic vs logical vs text).

## Error propagation

- Errors usually short-circuit the current expression branch.
- Functions may choose to absorb or expose errors based on semantics.
- Consistent error values make cross-binding behavior predictable.

## Short examples

```text
="1" + 2        -> 3
="x" + 2        -> #VALUE!
=IFERROR(A1, 0)  -> 0 when A1 is an error
```

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Document exact coercion matrix by operand type.
- Add function-by-function notes for error behavior differences.
