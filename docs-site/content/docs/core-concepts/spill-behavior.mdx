title: Spill Behavior
description: Learn how array-like results expand across cells and when spill conflicts occur.
---

Some formulas return multi-cell outputs. Formualizer treats these as spill ranges rooted at an anchor cell.

## Core ideas

- The anchor cell owns the formula and spill metadata.
- Neighbor cells inside the spill range expose derived values.
- Blocking content in the target range produces spill errors.

## Short example

```text
B2 = SEQUENCE(2, 3)
Spill target: B2:D3

If C2 already has a literal value, B2 evaluates to a spill-related error.
```

## Practical guidance

- Clear target ranges before writing dynamic array formulas.
- Recompute spill bounds when inputs change shape.
- Keep spill diagnostics explicit so users can fix conflicts quickly.

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add conflict resolution rules and overwrite policies.
- Add examples for resize and shrink scenarios.
