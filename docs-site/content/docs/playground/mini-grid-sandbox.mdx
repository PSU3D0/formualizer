title: Mini Grid Sandbox
description: Validate formula behavior in a lightweight spreadsheet-like grid context.

> **v1 scaffold:** This page describes a compact grid experience for end-to-end behavior checks.

## Intended v1 Capabilities

- Edit a small set of cells with literals and formulas.
- Recompute dependent cells and show dependency-driven updates.
- Surface cell-level errors with references back to formula inputs.

## Planned Follow-ups

- Seed templates for common scenarios (totals, lookups, date arithmetic).
- Import/export lightweight grid states for reproducible tests.
