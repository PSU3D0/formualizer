title: 'Mini Grid Sandbox'
description: A lightweight spreadsheet-like environment for testing formulas.
---

The Mini Grid Sandbox is a planned feature designed to provide a compact, spreadsheet-like interface for validating complex formula behaviors and inter-cell dependencies.

## What is the Mini Grid?

While the [Formula Sandbox](/docs/playground/formula-sandbox) focuses on individual expressions, the Mini Grid will allow you to:

- Edit a small grid of cells containing both literals and formulas.
- Visualize dependency chains between cells.
- Test "what-if" scenarios by updating input values and watching results propagate.
- Debug cell-level errors with full reference tracking.

## Status: Coming Soon

This feature is currently under development. In the meantime, you can use the following tools to explore the engine:

- **Function Reference**: Most pages in the [Function Reference](/docs/reference/functions) include a `FunctionSandbox` component where you can try out specific functions live.
- **Formula Parser**: Use the [Parser & AST Inspector](/docs/playground/parser-ast-inspector) to see how your formulas are being tokenized and structured by the engine.

Stay tuned for updates as we finalize the grid runtime and its integration with the documentation site.
