Use this section when you already know the basics and need concrete integration patterns.

## In this section

- [Workbook Edits and Batching](/docs/guides/workbook-edits-and-batching): grouped writes, undo boundaries, and evaluation patterns.
- [Custom Functions (Rust, Python, JS)](/docs/guides/custom-functions-rust-python-js): callback registration semantics and runtime parity.
- [WASM Plugins: Inspect, Attach, Bind](/docs/guides/wasm-plugins-inspect-attach-bind): Rust plugin lifecycle with feature/runtime gating.
- [LET/LAMBDA and Callables](/docs/guides/let-lambda-and-callables): currently implemented callable semantics and edge cases.
- [Deterministic Testing](/docs/guides/deterministic-testing): reproducible test checklist and command matrix.

## Suggested reading order

1. Start with [Workbook Edits and Batching](/docs/guides/workbook-edits-and-batching).
2. Add [Custom Functions (Rust, Python, JS)](/docs/guides/custom-functions-rust-python-js).
3. If needed, add [WASM Plugins: Inspect, Attach, Bind](/docs/guides/wasm-plugins-inspect-attach-bind).
4. Lock semantics with [LET/LAMBDA and Callables](/docs/guides/let-lambda-and-callables) and [Deterministic Testing](/docs/guides/deterministic-testing).
