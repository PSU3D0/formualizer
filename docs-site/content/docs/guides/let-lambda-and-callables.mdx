title: LET/LAMBDA and Callables
description: Build reusable expression logic with lexical bindings and first-class callable execution.
---

`LET` and `LAMBDA` enable composable formula logic and reduce repeated expression work.

## Mental model

- `LET` introduces local names for subexpressions.
- `LAMBDA` creates callable expressions with argument binding.
- Callables can be evaluated directly or passed to higher-order functions.

## Short examples

```text
=LET(x, A1*2, y, x+10, y)
```

```text
=LAMBDA(n, n*2)(21)
```

## Practical guidance

- Use `LET` for readability and repeated subexpression reuse.
- Validate argument count and scope resolution in callable execution.
- Ensure callable closures respect workbook context boundaries.

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add evaluator internals for lexical scope and callable lifetimes.
- Add coverage matrix for nested LET/LAMBDA edge cases.
