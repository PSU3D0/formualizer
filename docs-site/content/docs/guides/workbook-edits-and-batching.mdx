title: Workbook Edits and Batching
description: Apply many workbook changes efficiently while controlling recalculation cost.

Batching groups related edits so dependency invalidation and recalculation happen once per logical unit of work.

## Typical flow

- Start a batch scope.
- Apply many cell/value/formula edits.
- Commit and trigger recalculation once.

## Short example

```text
begin_batch()
set_value("A1", 10)
set_formula("B1", "=A1*2")
set_formula("C1", "=B1+5")
commit_batch()  // single invalidation + recalc pass
```

## Why this helps

- Fewer repeated graph traversals during bulk imports.
- More predictable performance for user-driven edit sessions.
- Cleaner event/log boundaries for debugging.

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add API-specific batching examples for Rust, Python, and JS.
- Add guidance for error handling inside failed batch commits.
