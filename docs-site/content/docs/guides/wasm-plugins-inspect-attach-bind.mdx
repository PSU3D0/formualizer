title: WASM Plugins: Inspect, Attach, Bind
description: Integrate WebAssembly plugins for runtime extension and workbook introspection workflows.
---

WASM plugins let you extend behavior without recompiling the core engine.

## Workflow

- **Inspect:** discover available plugin exports and metadata.
- **Attach:** load plugin into a host runtime with capability limits.
- **Bind:** map plugin functions to Formualizer callable interfaces.

## Practical concerns

- Validate plugin ABI/version compatibility before attach.
- Restrict host capabilities for deterministic and safe execution.
- Surface plugin load/runtime failures as standard evaluator errors.

## Short example

```text
plugin = load_wasm("stats.wasm")
exports = inspect(plugin)
attach(plugin)
bind_function("MEDIAN_FAST", exports.median_fast)
```

## TODO: Deep dive follow-ups

- Add end-to-end lifecycle diagram (load, validate, bind, unload).
- Add section on debugging host <-> plugin value marshalling.
