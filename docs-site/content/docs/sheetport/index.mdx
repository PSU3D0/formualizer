title: SheetPort
description: Treat spreadsheets as deterministic, typed functions.
---

SheetPort is the I/O layer of Formualizer. It allows you to treat any spreadsheet (Excel, CSV, or internal representation) as a typed function by mapping its cells and ranges to a structured manifest.

By defining inputs and outputs in a YAML manifest, you can decouple your application logic from the workbook layout. This enables:

- **Type Safety**: Enforce schemas and constraints on spreadsheet I/O.
- **Portability**: Run the same logic against different workbook versions or formats.
- **Integration**: Easily expose spreadsheet models as REST APIs or serverless functions.
- **AI Readiness**: Provide LLM agents with a reliable, structured interface to complex domain logic locked in spreadsheets.
