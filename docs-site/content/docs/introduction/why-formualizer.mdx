title: Why Formualizer?
description: Why teams choose Formualizer for spreadsheet logic in production systems.
---

Teams usually adopt Formualizer to stop duplicating formula logic across services and languages.

## Practical reasons to use it

- **Cross-runtime consistency**: Use the same workbook/formula behavior in Rust, Python, and WASM.
- **Spreadsheet-native model**: Work directly with sheets, cells, formulas, references, and recalculation.
- **Embeddable API**: Call workbook methods from your code instead of shelling out to office tooling.
- **Extensibility**: Add custom functions in each runtime when built-ins are not enough.

## Good fit

- You need deterministic workbook calculations in CI or production.
- You need one source of truth for formula behavior across backend + frontend.
- You need to load/edit/evaluate workbooks programmatically.

## Tradeoffs to plan for

- API surface is broad; start with quickstarts and grow incrementally.
- Pin versions and run workbook regression tests during upgrades.
