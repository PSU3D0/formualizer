title: Why Formualizer?
description: The main reasons teams adopt Formualizer.
---

Formualizer exists to provide a reliable and reusable formula layer instead of re-implementing formula logic per product or language.

Common reasons to adopt it:

- Consistent behavior across runtimes.
- Shared core engine with language-specific bindings.
- A foundation for extensible function libraries and workbook tooling.

## Tradeoffs and Expectations

Formualizer prioritizes correctness and portability. Some advanced ecosystem integrations are still expanding over time.
