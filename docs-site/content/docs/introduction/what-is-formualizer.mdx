title: What is Formualizer?
description: Formualizer is a cross-runtime spreadsheet engine with workbook APIs for Rust, Python, and WASM.

Formualizer is a spreadsheet formula engine you can embed in your own product.

It gives you one core behavior model across runtimes:

- Parse formulas into structured tokens/AST.
- Store workbook cells (values + formulas).
- Evaluate dependencies and return computed values.
- Reuse the same logic from Rust, Python, and JavaScript/WASM.

## Project surfaces

- **Rust crate**: `formualizer` (meta crate) plus focused crates like `formualizer-workbook`.
- **Python package**: `formualizer` (PyPI).
- **JS/WASM package**: `formualizer` (npm).

## Typical use cases

- Add Excel-like formulas to your app without embedding Excel.
- Recalculate workbook-driven business logic in backend jobs.
- Share one formula model between backend and frontend runtimes.
