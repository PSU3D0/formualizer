title: Versioning and Stability
description: How to interpret Formualizer's release and compatibility posture.
---

Formualizer follows an evolving maturity model. Not every surface area reaches the same stability level at the same time.

## Practical Guidance

- Pin versions in production deployments.
- Review changelogs for parser, evaluator, and bindings separately.
- Validate workbook behavior in CI when upgrading.

## Stability Signals

Use release notes, crate metadata, and binding documentation to determine readiness for your use case.
