description: Practical upgrade guidance for Formualizer crates and bindings.
---

Formualizer is moving quickly. Treat upgrades as engineering changes, not just dependency bumps.

## Safe upgrade workflow

1. **Pin versions** in Cargo/Python/npm lockfiles.
2. **Read release notes** and check changed APIs in Rust + bindings.
3. **Run workbook regression tests** on your own critical models.
4. **Validate cross-binding parity** if you ship more than one runtime.

## Commands worth running during upgrades

```bash
# Rust core/workbook
cargo test -p formualizer-eval
cargo test -p formualizer-workbook

# Python bindings
./scripts/dev-test.sh

# WASM bindings
cd bindings/wasm && npm test
```

## Compatibility posture to assume

- Behavior is strongest where there is explicit engine/binding test coverage.
- New feature surfaces (for example plugin runtime seams) may still evolve.
- Prefer additive integration patterns where possible (new functions/pages) over deep monkeypatching.
