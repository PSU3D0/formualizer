description: Understand what Formualizer provides, how the workspace is organized, and where to start.

Use this section to build a practical mental model before jumping into runtime-specific code.

## What you will learn

- What Formualizer includes (parser, evaluator, workbook APIs, language bindings).
- Why teams embed it instead of re-implementing formula logic.
- How the Rust workspace maps to Python and WASM bindings.
- How to make safe upgrade decisions for production use.
