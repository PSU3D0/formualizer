title: Architecture at a Glance
description: A high-level view of Formualizer's core modules.
---

Formualizer is organized as a Rust workspace with clear crate boundaries and optional language bindings.

## High-Level Components

- Parsing layer for tokenization and AST construction.
- Evaluation layer for function resolution and execution.
- Common shared types for values, errors, and workbook state.
- Bindings layer for Python and WebAssembly integration.

## Why This Layout

This separation keeps the core engine reusable while allowing bindings to evolve independently.

> **TODO:** Add a crate-level dependency diagram and execution flow from parse to evaluate.
