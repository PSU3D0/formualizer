description: How the Formualizer crates and bindings fit together.
---

Formualizer is a layered Rust workspace with language bindings built on top.

## Workspace layers

| Layer | Crates | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parse | `formualizer-parse` | Tokenize formula text and build ASTs |
| Evaluate | `formualizer-eval` | Execute formulas, built-ins, and dependency-aware evaluation |
| Shared types | `formualizer-common` | Values, errors, references, and shared enums |
| Workbook API | `formualizer-workbook` | High-level sheet/cell API, recalc, custom functions, plugin seams |
| Meta crate | `formualizer` | Re-exports core surfaces for easier app integration |

## Bindings

- **Python** (`bindings/python`): PyO3 binding over workbook + parser/eval surfaces.
- **WASM/JS** (`bindings/wasm`): `wasm-bindgen` wrapper with TypeScript API.

Both bindings map to the same underlying engine semantics, so workbook behavior should stay aligned across runtimes.

## Typical request flow

1. Write literals/formulas to workbook cells.
2. Parser converts formula text into AST.
3. Evaluator resolves references/functions and computes results.
4. Workbook graph tracks dependencies for incremental recalculation.

## Where to inspect implementation details

- Built-ins and evaluator internals: `crates/formualizer-eval/src/`
- Workbook API: `crates/formualizer-workbook/src/workbook.rs`
- Python binding: `bindings/python/src/`
- WASM binding: `bindings/wasm/src/`
