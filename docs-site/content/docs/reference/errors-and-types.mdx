title: Errors and Types
description: Shared type and error model guidance across Rust core and language bindings.
---

> **v1 scaffold:** This page captures the common model used to keep behavior consistent across targets.

## Core Type Model

- Formula values should preserve explicit kinds (number, text, boolean, blank, error, arrays/ranges where applicable).
- Bindings should avoid lossy coercions unless explicitly documented.
- Cross-language conversion should keep semantics aligned with engine expectations.

## Error Model

- Parse, evaluation, and binding-layer errors should remain distinguishable.
- Error payloads should include machine-readable codes plus user-readable messages.
- Binding adapters should preserve source context when available.
