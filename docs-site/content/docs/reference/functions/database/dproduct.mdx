title: "DPRODUCT"
description: "Multiplies values in a database field for records that satisfy criteria."
---

## Summary

`DPRODUCT` filters the database first, then returns the product of numeric values in `field`.

## Remarks
 - Criteria rows are evaluated as OR alternatives; criteria columns in one row are AND constraints.
 - `field` resolves via case-insensitive header text or 1-based column index; unresolved field references return `#VALUE!`.
 - If no numeric values match, this implementation returns `0`.
