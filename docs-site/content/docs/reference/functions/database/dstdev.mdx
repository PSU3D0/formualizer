description: "DSTDEV: Returns the sample standard deviation of a database field for matching records."
---

<FunctionPageSchema id="database/dstdev" />

## Summary

`DSTDEV` computes standard deviation with the sample denominator (`n - 1`) after criteria filtering.

## Remarks
 - Criteria rows represent OR branches; criteria columns in each row are combined with AND.
 - `field` is resolved by case-insensitive header text or 1-based column index; invalid field resolution returns `#VALUE!`.
 - At least two numeric values must match criteria, otherwise the result is `#DIV/0!`.

## FAQ

### Why does DSTDEV return #DIV/0! with one matching row?
DSTDEV uses sample statistics and needs at least two numeric matches for an n-1 denominator.
