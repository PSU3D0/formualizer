title: Function Reference
description: Strategy for generated function documentation and the upcoming function index/search experience.

> **v1 scaffold:** Function docs are planned as generated pages backed by registry metadata.

## Generation Strategy

- The Rust function registry remains the source of truth for function metadata.
- A docs generation step will emit normalized function records (name, category, arity, signatures, notes).
- MDX pages under this section will be generated from those records to avoid drift.

## URL and Page Structure

- Canonical pages will live under `/docs/reference/functions/...`.
- Each function page will include signatures, parameter notes, examples, and related functions.
- Category pages may be introduced once enough functions are documented.

## Upcoming Index/Search Behavior

- v1 index: precomputed list grouped by category and alpha order.
- v1 search: client-side filter by function name and aliases.
- follow-up filters: category, argument count, and volatility/behavior flags.
