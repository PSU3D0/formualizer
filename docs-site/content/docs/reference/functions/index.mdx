title: Function Reference
description: Generated function documentation backed by Rust source metadata and examples.
---

Function docs in this section are generated from Rust builtin definitions and docstrings.

## Generation Strategy

- The Rust function registry is the source of truth for arity, signatures, and capability metadata.
- Rust doc comments are the source of truth for summaries, remarks, and sandbox examples.
- Generated MDX pages keep runtime metadata and narrative docs synchronized.

## URL and Page Structure

- Canonical pages live under `/docs/reference/functions/...`.
- Each function page includes runtime metadata, behavior notes, and interactive examples.
- Category pages provide organized entry points by function family.

## Search and Discovery

- Docs search indexes this section through the site search API.
- Function pages include stable slugs for deep linking and external references.
- Follow-up enhancements can add richer filters (category, arg count, volatility).
