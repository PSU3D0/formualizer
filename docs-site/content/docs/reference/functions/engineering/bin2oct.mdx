## Summary

Supports optional left-padding through the `places` argument.

## Remarks
 - Input must be binary text up to 10 digits and may be signed two's-complement.
 - Signed values are preserved through conversion to octal.
 - `places` must be at least the output width and at most `10`, or `#NUM!` is returned.

## Examples

## FAQ

### How are signed 10-bit binaries handled by `BIN2OCT`?
They are first decoded as signed decimal and then re-encoded to octal with two's-complement output for negatives.
