## Summary

Returns the number of weekday business days between two dates, inclusive.

## Remarks
 - Weekends are fixed to Saturday and Sunday.
 - If `start_date &gt; end_date`, the result is negative.
 - The optional `holidays` argument is currently accepted but ignored; holiday exclusions are not yet supported.
 - Input serials are interpreted with Excel 1900 date mapping.

## FAQ

### Are custom holidays excluded in NETWORKDAYS right now?
Not yet. The third argument is accepted but currently ignored, so only Saturday/Sunday weekends are excluded.
