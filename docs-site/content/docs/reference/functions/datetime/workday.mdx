## Summary

Returns the date serial that is a given number of weekdays from a start date.

## Remarks
 - Positive `days` moves forward; negative `days` moves backward.
 - Weekends are fixed to Saturday and Sunday.
 - The optional `holidays` argument is currently accepted but ignored; holiday exclusions are not yet supported.
 - Input and output serials use Excel 1900 date mapping.

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Move forward by five workdays", "Holiday argument currently has no effect"]}>
<Tab value="Move forward by five workdays">
<FunctionSandbox
  title="Move forward by five workdays"
  formula={`=WORKDAY(45292, 5)`}
  grid={{}}
  expected={"45299"}

## FAQ

### Does WORKDAY include the start date when days=0?
Yes. With zero offset, WORKDAY returns the start date serial unchanged; nonzero offsets skip weekend days while stepping.
