## Summary

Returns the date serial that is a given number of weekdays from a start date.

## Remarks
 - Positive `days` moves forward; negative `days` moves backward.
 - Weekends are fixed to Saturday and Sunday.
 - The optional `holidays` argument is currently accepted but ignored; holiday exclusions are not yet supported.
 - Input and output serials use Excel 1900 date mapping.
