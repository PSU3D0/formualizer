<FunctionPageSchema id="datetime/now" />

## Summary

Returns the current date and time as a volatile datetime serial.

## Remarks
 - `NOW` is volatile and may produce a different value at each recalculation.
 - The integer part is the current date serial; the fractional part is time of day.
 - Serial output respects the active workbook date system (`1900` or `1904`).

## Examples

  grid={{}}
  expected={"true"}
/>
</Tab>

<Tab value="NOW is at or after TODAY">
<FunctionSandbox
  title="NOW is at or after TODAY"
  formula={`=NOW()>=TODAY()`}

## FAQ

### How do I isolate only the time portion from NOW?
Use NOW()-INT(NOW()); the integer part is date serial and the fractional part is time-of-day.
