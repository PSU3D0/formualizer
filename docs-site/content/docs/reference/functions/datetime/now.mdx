## Summary

Returns the current date and time as a volatile datetime serial.

## Remarks
 - `NOW` is volatile and may produce a different value at each recalculation.
 - The integer part is the current date serial; the fractional part is time of day.
 - Serial output respects the active workbook date system (`1900` or `1904`).

## Examples
